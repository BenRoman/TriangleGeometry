<div class="wikidoc"><h1>From Beta 3 To 4</h1>
Projects compiled against Beta 3 will no longer complile with Beta 4. There are a few breaking changes which will be explained below:<br />
<h2>1. InputGeometry replaced by IPolygon interface</h2>The new <i>IPolygon</i> interface allows direct access to Points, Segments, Holes and Regions, thus methods like <i>AddPoint</i> or <i>AddSegment</i> from the <i>InputGeometry</i> class are no longer needed. An additional method <i>AddContour</i> is part of the interface, which allows adding contours and (possibly non-convex) holes in an easy way.<br />
<h2>2. Removed public Mesh constructor</h2>A mesh can be created by the <i>GenericMesher</i> class in the <i>TriangleNet.Meshing</i> namespace. The preferred method is to use one of the extension methods of the <i>IPolygon</i> interface. If you simply want to triangulate a pointset, you now have access to the Delaunay algorithms in the <i>TriangleNet.Meshing.Algorithm</i> namespace.<br />
<h2>3. Removed public access to Behavior class</h2>Mesh creation can be controlled by the new <i>ConstraintOptions</i> and <i>QualityOptions</i> classes. The <i>Verbose</i> option was moved to the <i>Log</i> class. If you are missing any options, let me know!<br />
<h2>4. Removed Load method from Mesh class</h2>Use the <i>Converter</i> class in the <i>TriangleNet.Meshing</i> namespace or the <i>TriangleFormat</i> class in the <i>TriangleNet.IO</i> namespace to load meshes.<br />
<h2>5. Removed Smooth method from Mesh class</h2>Create an instance of the <i>SimpleSmoother</i> class in the <i>TriangleNet.Smoothing</i> namespace and call its <i>Smooth</i> method.<br />
<h2>6. Missing classes?</h2>Some classes have been renamed, some moved to other namespaces. If you are missing something let me know!<br /><br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
